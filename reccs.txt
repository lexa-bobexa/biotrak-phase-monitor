Based on my review of the codebase, here are several pre-deployment recommendations we can address one by one:

Error Handling and Logging Improvements:
The logging configuration is duplicated in both app.py and data_processing.py
We should consolidate logging configuration in one place
Add more detailed error logging for API calls

Session State Management:
The session state initialization is scattered throughout the code
We should consolidate session state initialization in one place
Add type hints for session state variables

Code Organization:
Move the CSS styles to a separate file
Create a dedicated configuration file for UI constants
Consider using a proper state management solution

Performance Optimizations:
Add caching for API responses
Implement batch processing for large files
Add progress tracking for individual API calls

Security Enhancements:
Add input validation for file uploads
Implement rate limiting for API calls
Add CSRF protection

Testing and Documentation:
Add unit tests for core functionality
Add integration tests for the API
Improve docstrings and add type hints
